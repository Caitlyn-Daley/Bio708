Does the degree of perturbation predict the magnitude of background dependence? 

This data set quantifies the mutant phenotypes (using wing area as a proxy) of an allelic series of three drosophila wing mutants in ~70 unique inbred lines (dataset not complete). This series of mutant alleles was chosen because the mutations span a range of weak to strong phenotypic effects (i.e. weak to strong reductions in wing tissue). The purpose of this experiment was to investigate how genetic background modulates the phenotypes of each mutant. Statistical/ biological questions I wish to address: 
Is there a relationship between the degree of perturbation (i.e weak, moderate or severe effects) and the magnitude of variability among strains (i.e. the degree of background dependence)?
Does the overall rank ordering of alleles (i.e OREW (control)<sd[1]<sd[ETX4]<sd[E3]) remain fixed across strains?
After accounting for variation in natural size effects, as well as block effects, how much variation in the phenotypes of each mutant allele among strains can be attributed to the genetic contribution of each DGRP line?
