\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 README- About the Experiment 
\f1\b0 \
The purpose of this experiment was to investigate how size variation affects susceptibility to predation, or predator induced natural selection. Since rearing flies at lower temperatures increases body size, flies were reared at 3 temperatures to create variation in body size; 18.5, 21 and 24 degrees. To account for possible \cf0 \cb1 \outl0\strokewidth0 temperature specific adaptive advantage during the experiment, temperature manipulation was only used during the rearing process.   \
\cf2 \cb3 \outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 \
Approximately ~200 adult flies from each rearing temperature were collected and then subdivided into treatment and control groups. Treatment populations were exposed to a predator (15 spiders) and monitored for survival for up to 6 days. The respective control population was \cf0 \cb1 \outl0\strokewidth0 reared at the same temperature and of similar age, but were not exposed to a predator. \
Measurements of the wing, tibia, femur and thorax (all of which are expected to be important traits in predation risk) were used to assess size. \
\

\f0\b Biological question to answer: 
\f1\b0 \
How does trait size affect susceptibility to predator induced natural selection? \
Which traits are under 
\f2\i direct
\f1\i0  selection?\
Which traits are under 
\f2\i indirect
\f1\i0  selection?\
What is the direction of selection for each trait? \

\fs24 \cf4 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 The\'a0selection differential\'a0is the difference of the base population mean and the mean of the\'a0population after predation.\'a0T\cf0 his is limiting because it doesn\'92t allow you to get information on targets of selection or adaptiveness of traits. To find out this information, you would use a selection gradient \cf4 \
\cf0 \
Simple univariate regressions estimate total selection on the trait, but fail to differentiate between direct selection and indirect selection (i.e. correlated traits). These regressions are called selection differentials.  \
\
To understand which traits are under direct selection and which are under indirect selection, we can use selection gradient analysis, which will allow us to look at traits independent of other traits that may or may not be correlated with adaptive evolution. \
\
Selection gradient analysis uses a multiple regression with partial regression coefficients for each individual trait. To compare traits, we can standardize our selection gradient and differentials by the amount of variation in the trait (i.e., by the standard deviation). Here, we will use linear coefficients in a mixed linear multiple regression model to quantify directional selection on each trait. Quadratic approaches would allow us to test correlational selection among traits, but this is beyond the scope of this course (and us\'85.). \
