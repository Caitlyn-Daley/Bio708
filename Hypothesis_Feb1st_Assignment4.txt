Hypothesis: Based on previous literature, I hypothesize that alleles sd[E3] and sd[ETX4] will exhibit more background dependence, demonstrating more phenotypic variability across strains, than either the control [OREw] allele or the weak allele [sd1]. Furthermore, I hypothesize that the allelic rank order of alleles will remain fixed across strains.To test this statistically, I could use a mixed linear model. This will help account for both fixed effects (mutant allele) and random effects (DGRP, block) to better determine whether the variance in mutant phenotypes arises from genetic (DGRP) or environmental effects (Block). Furthermore, given the effect of either DGRP or Block may be subtle or small, it makes sense to use both P values for clarity but more importantly, use confidence intervals to access how well the means of each cross represents the true estimate for each genotype.
