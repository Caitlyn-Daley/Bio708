Description for assignment two: January 18th 

Describe what sort of investigations you might do with your data, and how you might break your project into replicable components: 

From this dataset I am hoping to investigate the degree of variability (the magnitude genetic background effect) for each mutant allele. I am testing a hypothesis that the mutant alleles with moderate phenotypic effects (sd[ETX4], sd[E3]) demonstrate more variability between strains than mutant alleles with weaker or more severe effects (reduced tissue growth). In addition, I would like to investigate whether the allelic order of the mutant alleles (i.e OREw<sd[1]<sd[ETX4]<sd[E3]) remains consistent accross strains, and there is no reordering (weak -> severe) of mutant allele phenotypic effects. I am hoping to isolate the effect of genetic background on mean phenotype from environmental effects (i.e block effects)

I am unsure if you mean biological or statistical replicable components (maybe they're one in the same?), but: 
To break the project into (biological) replicable components, the genetic crosses (Mutant X DGRP) were done in blocks. Each experimental block of crosses was set up seperately. Each (Mutant X DGRP) cross was done at least twice accross blocks. In some circumstances the cross may have been done ~3-4 times to account for crosses that did not yield any flies. 


Data set for assignment one: January 11th 

This data set describes the phenotypes of male progeny from the crosses with an allelic series of three drosophila mutants in the scalloped gene (X-chromosome) to ~70 unique inbred lines (dataset not complete). Each individual in this dataset possesses a mutant X-chromosome, and are heterozygous on the autosomes for a common genetic background (Oregon-R), and a genetically unique isogenic, inbred line (DGRP lines). The phenotypes of the scalloped mutants in this dataset manifest in the wing by reducing wing tissue and consequently wing size and wing shape. This particular series of mutant alleles spans a breadth of weak to strong phenotypic effects (i.e. weak to strong reductions in wing tissue); sd[1], sd[ETX4] and sd[E3] respectively.

The purpose of this experiment was to investigate how genetic background modulates the phenotypes of each mutant. Important biological questions include: 

Is there a relationship between the degree of perturbation (i.e weak, moderate or severe effects) and the magnitude of variability across strains (i.e. the degree of background dependence)?

Does the overall rank ordering of alleles (i.e sd[1]<sd[ETX4]<sd[E3]) remain fixed across strains?

Wing area is used as a proxy to measure the degree of phenotypic severity, relative to the control cross (wildtype OREw X unqiue DGRP) to account for natural variation in size effects.
