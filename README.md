Data set for assignment one: January 11th 

This data set describes the phenotypes of male progeny from the crosses with an allelic series of three drosophila mutants in the scalloped gene (X-chromosome) to ~70 unique inbred lines (dataset not complete). Each individual in this dataset possesses a mutant X-chromosome, and are heterozygous on the autosomes for a common genetic background (Oregon-R), and a genetically unique isogenic, inbred line (DGRP lines). The phenotypes of the scalloped mutants in this dataset manifest in the wing by reducing wing tissue and consequently wing size and wing shape. This particular series of mutant alleles spans a breadth of weak to strong phenotypic effects (i.e. weak to strong reductions in wing tissue); sd[1], sd[ETX4] and sd[E3] respectively.

The purpose of this experiment was to investigate how genetic background modulates the phenotypes of each mutant. Important biological questions include: 

Is there a relationship between the degree of perturbation (i.e weak, moderate or severe effects) and the magnitude of variability across strains (i.e. the degree of background dependence)?

Does the overall rank ordering of alleles (i.e sd[1]<sd[ETX4]<sd[E3]) remain fixed across strains?

Wing area is used as a proxy to measure the degree of phenotypic severity, relative to the control cross (wildtype OREw X unqiue DGRP) to account for natural variation in size effects.
